## About the App

This app was initially created to solve the problem of not being able to "Certify" everyday accomplishments. Whether it's acknowledging a certain book you've read,  the fact that you know how to fix a busted pipe (plumbing knowledge), or simply acknowledging your love of all things sports-related; Certified helps you exhibit your skills. Here, by taking a series of short tests, you'll receive a badge that you can place on things like: your resume, Facebook profile page, or Tinder account (wink wink). Not only can you inform people about your skills, you can have proof that you're able to do it! 


## How to Use

1. You'll be directed to the sign up page. Simply create an account and log in.
2. Next you'll have to decide on which skills you'd like a badge for. Choose a test that best evaluates your skills.
3. You must get at least 7 of the 10 questiosn correctly to receive a badge.
4. Go to the "Profile" page to view the badges that you've earned.
5. Celebrate by showing off your hard-earned badges!

## Future updates

1. Setting a timer for each test.
2. Creating some unique way of users displaying their badges (so they can't just take an image of a badge, from the internet, and show it off).
3. Giving users an ability to create tests.
